# RETRACING of features to match coastline
# This dataset is used to create buffers for the population and shoreline
# modification projects.

# There are many gaps between seagrass meadows and coastline, more than just 
# 100m. Therefore, if I only buffer by 100m then I am not selecting much of the 
# coastline. To deal with this:
# After much deliberation and testing automated methods the only sure way is to
# digitize. There is way too much variability in distances. If I add a series of
# buffers and move some but not others then it gets way too complicated and \
# loses accuracy.

#   double click in grey area of row to zoom to feature
#   create an attribute to keep track of where I am
#   Criteria for whether or not I edit the feature: I ended up digitizing most 
#   of them even if it was just a small area. However, in some areas if it was 
#   just a sliver and there was clearly no development then I didn't bother.

# This work was done previously and it is just copied here for record keeping.
# This dataset gets referenced by other scripts, so I want it in a central place.
# This dataset had a lot of manual work involved so it is good that it is backed
# up in numerous places.
